Web design keeps me grounded in new trends from a design and development
perspective, while providing me the satisfaction of bringing a concept from idea
to implementation. Here are a few web projects I've implemented for customers.

Most of these are Wordpress website where I've created the theme and made all
the fields customizable by the customer.
