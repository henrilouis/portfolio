summary:
  'Designing digital products and services for healthcare practitioners to
  improve staff experience, lower cost of care, improve patient experience and
  ultimately lead to better health outcomes.'

## Roles and responsibilities

- Lead design teams for the cardiology informatics and enterprise diagnostic
  informatics business, creating a diagnostic software platform for healthcare
  providers.
- Create and validate product visions with users and stakeholders.
- Define and create high level design modules to harmonize within Philips.
- Contribute to Philips' design system (DLS) and maintain a CSS toolkit.

## Challenges for software in healthcare

The state of software user experiences is healthcare is pretty grave (with some
notable exceptions). Software usability issues are a contributing factor to
physician burn-out. Many clinicians feel like glorified data entry clerks due to
regulatory requirements and the lack of interoperability between systems:
duplicate data entry.

What makes this market interesting is the lack of competition as compared to
consumer products: these products are bought during large tender deals that span
multiple years, reducing competition to a small window in time. The products are
complex while serving smaller niches in healthcare, leading them to mostly
compete on features, trying to catch up to the competition, leaving little room
to make the experience better.

## Vision

By applying **user centered design** we create large improvements to the status
quo. We make experiences that delight the clinician while solving their problems
with as little friction as possible. This allows clinicians to focus on the
patient, not the software.

Healthcare software is complex and requires deep understanding of the workflow.
To be able to de-risk the experience before we invest in development and
go-to-market, we use **high fidelity prototypes** that are evaluated and
iterated on with users.

To be able to provide this in an environment where competition is still largely
on features we create modular experiences that can be re-used among multiple
similar products. This allows for a more unified experience, increased
validation, and a more efficient implementation.

## Projects

Most projects are confidential, below are a few that are no longer under
embargo.

### Cardiovascular care orchestrator

a suite of applications to help a cardiologist get an understanding of the
patient to help with decision making. The design has received both a
[red-dot](https://www.red-dot.org/project/cardiovascular-care-orchestrator-55426)
and
[iF](https://ifdesign.com/en/winner-ranking/project/cardiovascular-care-orchestrator/301044)
award.
