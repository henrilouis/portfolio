## Challenges for software in healthcare

The state of software user experiences is healthcare is pretty grave (with some
notable exceptions). Software usability issues are a contributing factor to
physician burn-out while many clinicians feel like glorified data entry clerks.

One of the contributing factors is the lack of competition, given these products
are bought during large tender deals that span multiple years, reducing
competition to a small window in time.

Next to that the products are complex while serving smaller niches in
healthcare, leading them to mostly compete on features, trying to catch up to
the competition.

## Vision

By applying user centered design we create large improvements to the status quo.
We make experiences that delight the clinician while solving their problems with
as little friction as possible. This allows clinicians to focus on the patient,
not the software.

Healthcare software is very complex and requires deep understanding of the
workflow. To be able to de-risk the experience before we invest in development
and go-to-market, we use high fidelity prototypes that are tested with users.
