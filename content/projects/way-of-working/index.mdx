## Design principles

### User and business goals at the center

Holding these central leads to profitable products that make users happy.

### Function and form

A product's primary purpose is to allow the user to accomplish his or her task
as easy as possible. This is about reducing friction. Beautiful esthetics can
then be applied to further enhance this and delight the user.

### Occam's razor

The simplest solution almost always is the best. Getting to this is hard, but
it's worth the effort.

## Process in my current team

My current design team in Philips works close to the business. As designers we
align horizontally in that team to make sure our design decisions are in line.
Each designer (or more) also each are responsible for a product and host formal
reviews with the product teams. This includes the Product Manger, Product Owner,
Subject Matter Expert, Architect and Lead Engineer for the product.

Design thinking, although a buzzword, does describe the way we currently
approach design, iteratively increasing understanding of how to solve a certain
problem. Design in this way acts as the scientific method for business, allowing
early and rigurous de-risking before going to market with a product.

We move through the first five phases iteratively with the product teams to get
to a degree of certainty and common understanding before the engineering team
starts on the implementation.
