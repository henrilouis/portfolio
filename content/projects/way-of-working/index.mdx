## Design principles

### User and business goals

Holding these central leads to profitable products that make users happy.

### Form follows function

A product's primary task is to allow the user to accomplish his or her task as
easy as possible. I marry the rigt balance between function and esthetics to
make the experience enjoyable while not distracting from the task.

### Occam's razor

The simplest solution almost always is the best. Getting to this is hard, but
it's worth the effort.

## Process in my current team

My current design team in Philips works close to the business. As designers we
align horizontally in that team to make sure our design decisions are in line.
Each designer (or more) also each are responsible for a product and host formal
reviews with the product teams. This includes the Product Manger, Product Owner,
Subject Matter Expert, Architect and Lead Engineer for the product.

Design thinking, although a buzzword, does describe the way we currently
approach design, iteratively increasing understanding of how to solve a certain
problem. Design in this way acts as the scientific method for business, allowing
early and rigurous de-risking before going to market with a product.

We move through the first five phases iteratively with the product teams to get
to a degree of certainty and common understanding before the engineering team
starts on the implementation.
