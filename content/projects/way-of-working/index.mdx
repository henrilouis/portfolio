summary: 'Like most designers I apply the design thinking process to my work, iteratively
increasing understanding of how to solve a certain problem.'

## Design thinking

Design thinking is a fancy way of saying we applying the scientific method to
business, allowing early and rigurous de-risking before going to market with a
product.

There's no one way to describe this process, apart from that it always involves
iterative learning. My approach looks a little like this:

### Empathize

We start with understanding the users challenges and context. This can be
through interviews, observational studies or desk research. In a later stage or
for an existing product this could involve studying analytics data to identify
issues.

### Define

We condense and analyse the information gathered and try to identify the main
problems. As part of this we create design artifacts like persona's, customer
journey's, workflow mappings, storyboards etc.

### Ideate

Now we're generating ideas on how to address the problems we've identified. We
create a value proposition that would fit the persona, context and problems.

Then we define hypotheses or assumptions that still need to be tested and
tracked through the process.

### Prototype

We move from idea to the fastest implementation that will allow us to learn.
This stage can be addressed in different ways depending on the project. At the
start of a new project we use low fidelity prototypes to test new ideas. Later
if we're a few iterations further and we know more we can use high fidelity
prototypes to nail the details.

I'm a strong proponent of doing this together with front-end developers in code.
This requires a good design system and development toolkits in place, but it can
allow us to de-risk the actual experience.

### Test

Perform tests with users in their context, to test our proposition, hypotheses,
assumptions and other things we don't expect.

Each of these steps inform eachother, in no way is this linear.
