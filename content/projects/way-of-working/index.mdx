## Design thinking

Like most designers I naturally apply the design thinking process to my work,
iteratively increasing understanding of how to solve a certain problem.

Design thinking is a fancy way of saying we applying the scientific method to
business, allowing early and rigurous de-risking before going to market with a
product.

There's no one way to describe this process, apart from that it always involves
iterative learning. My approach looks a little like this:

## Study

We start with understanding the users challenges and context. This can be
through interviews, observational studies or desk research. In a later stage or
for an existing product this could involve studying analytics data to identify
issues.

As part of this we create design artifacts like persona's, customer journey's,
workflow mappings, storyboards etc.

## Ideate

Now we're generating ideas on how to address the problems we've identified. We
create a value proposition that would fit the persona, context and problems.

Then we define hypotheses or assumptions that still need to be tested and
tracked through the process.

## Prototype

We move from idea to the fastest implementation that will allow us to learn.
This stage can be addressed in different ways depending on the project. At the
start of a new project we use low fidelity prototypes to test new ideas. Later
if we're a few iterations further and we know more we can use high fidelity
prototypes to nail the details.

## Test

Test with users in their context, to test our proposition, hypotheses,
assumptions and other things we don't expect.

Each of these steps inform eachother, in no way is this linear.
