# Henri SchrÃ¶ter (designer) portfolio website

[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com) setup for my portfolio website. Feel free to
fork and copy. Based on the
[Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/).

## ðŸš€ Quick start

Start by forking and/or clonding the repository and installing the required
packages by running

```shell
npm install
```

This project relies on the Gatsby CLI:
([install instructions](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-0/#gatsby-cli))

After installing run:

```shell
gatsby develop
```

Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000` and graphQL is running at
`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`.

## Adding projects

To add a project add a sub-folder to the projects folder, containing at least an
index.mdx file.

## Building the static website

Building again relies on the Gatsby CLI:

```shell
gatsby build
```

The output is at x.
